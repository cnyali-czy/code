107

do not stand at my grave and weep
i am not there 
i do not sleep

i am in a thousand wind that blow
across northreands bright and shining snow

i am the gentle shower of rain
on westfalls fields of golden grain

i am in the morning hush
of stragnlethorns jungle
green and lush

i am in the drums loud and grand
the thunderous hooves across nagrand

i am the stars warmly gleaming
over darnassus softly dreaming

i am in the birds that sing
i am in each lovely thing

do not stand at my grave and weep
i am not there
i do not die
